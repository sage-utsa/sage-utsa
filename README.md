> *"The truth is out there. So is the source code."*

Welcome. You’ve found the academic repository of Sage: a UTSA Computer Science student with a background in sound design, military intelligence, and a persistent curiosity about the systems most people overlook.

This account serves as a repository of my coursework, collaboration, and code from my time at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

##  About Me

- **Student**: Computer Science (Cyber Operations concentration), UTSA
- **Prior Field**: Sound design + military intelligence
- **Languages**: C, C++, Java, Python
- **Special Interests**: Low-level programming, security, embedded systems, and the intersection of signal and noise

## 📂 What You'll Find

- Android and Java-based group projects
- C/C++ assignments and data structures work
- Experimental reports and class deliverables



## 🕵️‍♂️ Disclaimer

This repository documents the process, not the polish.

Some of this code was written in deadlines’ long shadows. Some under the weight of group dynamics, caffeine, or institutional expectations. It’s not optimized for show it’s real, functional, and traceable to the moment it was needed.

Mistakes are left in where they teach something. Hacks are sometimes intentional. This isn't a curated portfolio, it's a case file. A log of the journey, unredacted.
